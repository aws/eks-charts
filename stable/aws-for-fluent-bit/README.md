| `kinesis.stream` | The name of the Kinesis Data Stream that you want log records sent to. | `"my-kinesis-stream-name"` | ✔
| `kinesis.partitionKey` | A partition key is used to group data by shard within a stream. A Kinesis Data Stream uses the partition key that is associated with each data record to determine which shard a given data record belongs to. For example, if your logs come from Docker containers, you can use container_id as the partition key, and the logs will be grouped and stored on different shards depending upon the id of the container they were generated from. As the data within a shard are coarsely ordered, you will get all your logs from one container in one shard roughly in order. If you don't set a partition key or put an invalid one, a random key will be generated, and the logs will be directed to random shards. If the partition key is invalid, the plugin will print an warning message. | `"container_id"` |
| `kinesis.appendNewline` | If you set append_newline as true, a newline will be addded after each log record. | |
| `kinesis.replaceDots` | Replace dot characters in key names with the value of this option. | |

| `s3.enabled` | Whether this plugin should be enabled or not, [details](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/s3) | `false`
| `s3.match` | The log filter. | `"*"`
| `s3.bucket` | S3 Bucket name. |
| `s3.region` | The AWS region of your S3 bucket. | `"us-east-1"`
| `s3.jsonDateKey` | Specify the name of the time key in the output record. To disable the time key just set the value to false. | `"date"`
| `s3.jsonDateFormat` | Specify the format of the date. Supported formats are double, epoch, iso8601 (eg: 2018-05-30T09:39:52.000681Z) and java_sql_timestamp (eg: 2018-05-30 09:39:52.000681). | `"iso8601"`

| `s3.uploadTimeout` | Whenever this amount of time has elapsed, Fluent Bit will complete an upload and create a new file in S3. For example, set this value to 60m and you will get a new file every hour. | `"10m"`
| `s3.storeDir` | Directory to locally buffer data before sending. When multipart uploads are used, data will only be buffered until the `upload_chunk_size` is reached. S3 will also store metadata about in progress multipart uploads in this directory; this allows pending uploads to be completed even if Fluent Bit stops and restarts. It will also store the current $INDEX value if enabled in the S3 key format so that the $INDEX can keep incrementing from its previous value after Fluent Bit restarts. | `"/tmp/fluent-bit/s3"`
| `s3.storeDirLimitSize` | The size of the limitation for disk usage in S3. Limit the amount of s3 buffers in the `store_dir` to limit disk usage. Note: Use `store_dir_limit_size` instead of `storage.total_limit_size` which can be used to other plugins, because S3 has its own buffering system. | `0`
| `s3.s3KeyFormat` | Format string for keys in S3. This option supports UUID (`$UUID`), strftime time formatters, `$INDEX`, a syntax for selecting parts of the Fluent log tag using `$TAG`/`$TAG[n]` inspired by the rewrite_tag filter.

| `s3.s3KeyFormatTagDelimiters` | A series of characters which will be used to split the tag into 'parts' for use with the s3_key_format option. See the in depth examples and tutorial in the [documentation](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/s3/). |
| `s3.staticFilePath` | Disables behavior where UUID string is automatically appended to end of S3 key name when $UUID is not provided in s3_key_format. $UUID, time formatters, $TAG, and other dynamic key formatters all work as expected while this feature is set to true. | `false`
| `s3.usePutObject` | Use the S3 PutObject API, instead of the multipart upload API. Check [documentation](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/s3) for more details. | `false`

| `s3.contentType` | A standard MIME type for the S3 object; this will be set as the Content-Type HTTP header. |
| `s3.sendContentMd5` | Send the Content-MD5 header with PutObject and UploadPart requests, as is required when Object Lock is enabled. | `false`
| `s3.autoRetryRequests` | Immediately retry failed requests to AWS services once. This option does not affect the normal Fluent Bit retry mechanism with backoff. Instead, it enables an immediate retry with no delay for networking errors, which may help improve throughput when there are transient/random networking issues. This option defaults to true. Please check [here]( https://github.com/aws/aws-for-fluent-bit/blob/mainline/troubleshooting/debugging.md#network-connection-issues) for more details. | `true`
| `s3.logKey` | By default, the whole log record will be sent to S3. If you specify a key name with this option, then only the value of that key will be sent to S3. For example, if you are using Docker, you can specify `log_key log` and only the log message will be sent to S3. |
| `s3.preserveDataOrdering` | Normally, when an upload request fails, there is a high chance for the last received chunk to be swapped with a later chunk, resulting in data shuffling. This feature prevents this shuffling by using a queue logic for uploads. | `true`
| `s3.storageClass` | Specify the storage class for S3 objects. If this option is not specified, objects will be stored with the default 'STANDARD' storage class. | |
| `s3.retryLimit`| Integer value to set the maximum number of retries allowed. Note: this configuration is released since version 1.9.10 and 2.0.1. For previous version, the number of retries is 5 and is not configurable. |`1`|
| `s3.externalId`| Specify an external ID for the STS API, can be used with the role_arn parameter if your role requires an external ID.
| `s3.extraOutputs`| Append extra outputs with value. This section helps you extend current chart implementation with ability to add extra parameters. For example, you can add [network](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/networking) config like `s3.extraOutputs.net.dns.mode=TCP`. | |
